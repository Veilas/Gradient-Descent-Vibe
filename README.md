# Gradient-Descent-Wiebe
Matlab code for approximating heat release of a disel engine given by exprimental data using the sum of two wiebe functions which parameters are deterimend by gradinet descent.


### Input
#### Required:
- dQ - represents experimantal data of heat release of a disel engine as data points

#### Optional:
- b - maximum heat released - default: 6.908 
- deltat - time step used for sampling of experimental data - default: 0.1

### Output:
- [a1, T1, r1, a2, T2, r2]
